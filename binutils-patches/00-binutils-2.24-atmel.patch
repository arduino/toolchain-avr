+;;; You only need to use this file if you're using a version of Emacs
+;;; prior to 20.1 to work on GDB.  The only difference between this
+;;; and the standard add-log.el provided with 19.34 is that it
+;;; generates dates using the terser format used by Emacs 20.  This is
+;;; the format recommended for use in GDB ChangeLogs.
+;;;
+;;; To use this code, you should create a directory `~/elisp', save the code
+;;; below in `~/elisp/add-log.el', and then put something like this in
+;;; your `~/.emacs' file, to tell Emacs where to find it:
+;;; 
+;;; (setq load-path
+;;;       (cons (expand-file-name "~/elisp")
+;;;             load-path))
+;;; 
+;;; If you want, you can also byte-compile it --- it'll run a little
+;;; faster, and use a little less memory.  (Not that those matter much for
+;;; this file.)  To do that, after you've saved the text as
+;;; ~/elisp/add-log.el, bring it up in Emacs, and type
+;;; 
+;;;     C-u M-x byte-compile-file
